              In January 2017, Loretta Sanders, educator and school
              administrator, reached out to 20 friends and asked them to join
              her in a 21-day fast. She formed a WhatsApp group that was used to
              share resources and support each other through encouragement and
              prayer focus for 21 days.
              <br />
              <br />
              After the fast was over, the group supported and covered one
              another in prayer.
              <br />
              <br /> Being led by the Spirit of the Living God, and with much
              prayer, on January 29, 2017, Loretta changed the groupâ€™s name from
              21- Day Fasting & Praying to Loving Grace Assembly.
              <br />
              <br /> With the group in agreeance Elder, Dr. Loretta sought a
              location for their first service on Easter Sunday, April 16, 2017.
